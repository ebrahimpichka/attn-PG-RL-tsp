# Attention-based Policy Gradient RL for learning to solve Travelling Salesperson Problem


A PyTorch implementation of the attention-based Policy Gradient RL for learning to solve Travelling Salesperson Problem based on the paper https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93031-2_12 


This project is the PyTorch implementation of the attention-based policy gradient for solving TSP based on the paper [Learning Heuristics for the TSP by Policy Gradient](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-93031-2_12) [[PDF here]](https://hanalog.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cpaior-learning-heuristics-6.pdf)

The paper also incorporates a 2-opt heuristic to the RL algorithm, which we did not include here. Please refer to the paper for a more detailed explanation of the methodology.
